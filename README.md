## **Project Overview**  

The Olympics Data Transformation and Visualization project addresses the need to process large volumes of historical sports data and present them in an intuitive and interactive format.  

The project uses **modular components** for:  
- Cleaning and preparing raw datasets for analysis.  
- Providing interactive dashboards with detailed insights into Olympic events.  
- Supporting APIs for accessing transformed and structured data.  

With this project, users can analyze key trends, such as:  
- Performance evolution of countries and athletes over decades.  
- Medal distribution across events and games.  
- Insights into sport-specific growth and participation.
